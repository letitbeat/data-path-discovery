# SDN Data-path Discovery

Docker compose file containing the services required to run the SDN Data-path discovery simulations.

## Services

* [ONOS][1] SDN Controller.
* [Data-plane emulator][2] Emulates a network topology and includes a network packet sniffer which is installed at all network interfaces of the data-plane forwarding devices, that forwards the traffic to the [analyzer][3].
* [Data-path analyzer][3] Tool that receives the packets, filters the packets having the UID and computes the flow trees from the set of observations.
* [UI][4] Web-based interface for discovering the data-paths that receives the interesting traffic to discover from the user and reports the resulting data-paths (in the form of a flow tree).
* [MongoDB][5] Database to store packets and data required by the [analyzer][3].
* [MongoDB Express][6] Web-based admin interface for MongoDB. *Optional*

### Video

### Prerequisites

* [Docker][7] Please refer to Docker [documentation][9] for detailed instructions on how to install it according to your platform.
* [Docker Compose][8] Once Docker is installed, you can proceed to [install][10] Docker Compose.

### How to run

Create and start the containers:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Once the containers are started you can proceed to create the network topology and start the packet sniffer from within the data-plane container:

```bash
docker exec -it data-path-discovery_dp_1 bash
```

Inside the container execute:

```bash
python create_topology.py -a
```

To this point you should be able to visualize the topology and start using web interface at the following url:
`http://localhost:5000/`
